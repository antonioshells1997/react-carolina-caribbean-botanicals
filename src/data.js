Additionally, they also leave the skin soft and supple. Neem leaves are dried and burnt to keep away mosquitoes. They also act as a natural pesticide. Dried leaves protect rice kept in containers and clothes kept in drawers from insects. Drinking water infused with neem leaves controls high blood sugar. The leaves help to dilate blood vessels impeding blood coagulation, decrease elevated heart rates and relax erratic heartbeats. This is due to the presence of antihistamine compounds in them, and as a result, neem leaves keep a check on high blood pressure levels.',

Fluoride has been shown to have negative effects on cognitive abilities, but the use of tamarind can help the body expel this mineral. Tamarind has also played an important role in traditional medicine. Traditional medicine practitioners and healers around the world have used the beverage form of tamarind to commonly treat diarrhea, constipation, fever and peptic ulcers. They also use the bark and leaves to promote wound healing by creating a paste from the pulp as a makeshift band-aid. The polyphenols in tamarind have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which are important for protecting the epidermis from constant exposure from free radicals. In addition, these polyphenols can protect against diseases such as heart disease, cancer and diabetes. The seed extract may also help lower blood sugar, while the pulp extract may help you lose body weight and reverse fatty liver disease.',
